# Hey there, I'm Xen!

I'm a passionate **web development learner** on a mission to create meaningful tools from scratch.  
Currently focused on building the skills needed to one day contribute to **Loomed Charm**, a premium clothing brand run by someone very important to me.

### What I'm learning:
- **HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript**
- Terminal-based development using **Neovim** + **Termux**
- Git & GitHub for version control
- MySQL basics, and soon: **React**, **Node.js**, **Java (Spring Boot)**

### Why I'm doing this:
To support a vision I believe in, and to someday help build **real products that matter**.
